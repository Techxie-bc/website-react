Using create-react-app, set up a react app named ‘website’. 
Inside the src folder, create a file called ‘Header.js’. Inside this file, create a function that returns the JSX version of the HTML code below 
<header>
     <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   </header>


Inside the src folder, create a file called Main.js’. Inside this file, create a function that returns the JSX version of the HTML code below:
<main>
     <section>
       <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p>

         specialise in creating modern and responsive websites for businesses

         <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
       </ul>
     </section>
   </main>

Go to the App.js file and delete all the current JSX in the return statement. Now instantiate the Header and the Main components inside the return statement.
Run npm start in your terminal to load your browser, where you will see the result of your implementation.  Congratulations! You have just created your first react app.,
To demonstrate JavaScript in JSX, create a variable called country inside the Main function in the Main.js file and assign the name of your country to that variable. Look for the United States in the JSX and replace it with the country variable wrapped in curly braces. Confirm in your browser that you can see the result of that change. 
Push your code to a Github repository and submit the link to that repository in Citrone.
